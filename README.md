Welcome to my portfolio. These are a few projects that I have worled on to test my skills and to show what I am capable of. I will continue to post as I go along and to update the already exisiting projects. Hope you like what you see!

### [Wine Prediction - K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (KNN)](https://github.com/tom10203/Wine-KNN)
This is a KNN algorithm that I wrote down from scratch. I have then used the alogorithm to predict the quality of a wine based on its features.
Here are some of the key steps in vloved in making this project:
- Download the dataset from Kaggle.
- Wrangle the data to get it to be usable.
- Make a function to normalise the data, find the distance between datapoints and return a value.
